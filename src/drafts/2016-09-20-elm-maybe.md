Opposed to JavaScript and many other programming languages, Elm does not have the concept of `undefined` or `null` values. Of course there are cases in which variables contain nothing or functions cannot return a proper value – but instead of leaving it up to you whether or not to handle these cases, Elm makes them explicit with a type called `Maybe` and enforces the handling thereof.

The [`Maybe`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/3.0.0/Maybe) module contains the type as well as some helper functions for dealing with with optional arguments, error handling, and records with optional fields. `Maybe` itself is a [union type](/articles/elm-data-structures-uniton-type.html) type Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing

case maybe of
  Just xs -> xs
  Nothing -> []
