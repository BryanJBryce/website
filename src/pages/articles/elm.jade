    h2 Elm – functional frontend development
    p
      | Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Opposed
      | to JavaScript, Elm is statically typed. The compiler type checks the code and
      | guarantees to generate reliable code that will not throw any runtime exceptions.
      | Consequently even the view is statically typed – the templates, which are written
      | in elm-html, are based on the concept of the Virtual DOM, just like in React.
    p
      | The syntax might look odd at first if you have not worked with a functional
      | programming language before, nevertheless it is very clear and does not take
      | much time to get used to in my opinion. The following articles introduce you
      | to the fundamentals of funtional frontend development with Elm.
