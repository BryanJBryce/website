        <div class='content'><p>I am currently working on <a href="http://ioctocat.com">iOctocat v2.0</a> and because people keep asking, here are&#x000A;thoughts and insights I would like to share about the progress and ideas behind it.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>In general</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>v2 will be <em>a new app</em> and in contrast to the current version 1 <em>it will not be universal</em>, which means&#x000A;separate apps for the iPhone and iPad.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Up to now, the iPad version of the app has been neglected and has not gotten the attention it deserves.&#x000A;There have been attempts to create an unique experience which utilizes the surplus of screen real estate,&#x000A;but those have not gotten very far, because I wanted to make the app feature complete before improving the UI.&#x000A;As a result I made v1 universal to please everyone who would like to use the app on the iPad, even though it&#x000A;is just a scaled up version of the iPhone UI. Judging from the reviews and feedback I got, this made half of&#x000A;the user base happy, because they liked having a single app which they paid for once and could use on all their&#x000A;devices. The other half was buying the app because they wanted it to work primarily on their iPad - those users&#x000A;felt like they did not fully get what they wanted and I can totally understand that.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>To make a long story short: <em>v2.0 will be iPhone only at first</em>, because I still wanted to make it feature&#x000A;complete first. Once that is out on the App Store I will work on v2.1 to make the app ready for iOS 7.&#x000A;This will be a big deal and include some major UI changes I have postponed so far, because I would have to&#x000A;redo the UI with iOS 7 anyways. After that and having done the inevitable UI changes, I want to devote the time&#x000A;and energy to bring you the iPad experience of iOctocat we all have been waiting for.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>E.T.A.</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>My initial plan was to release v2.0 alongside iOS 7 this fall. I have been able to work on the app full time&#x000A;for the past weeks and have made good progress by now, which led to the decision to release it earlier than&#x000A;that. As the app is almost feature complete with what I planned for the new version it does not make too much&#x000A;sense to wait for iOS 7 - in fact it would be counterproductive: Shipping v2.0 would have been too much of a&#x000A;big bang release with lots of new features and a complete overhaul of the UI, which in itself will take me some&#x000A;time to get right - even when focusing on the iPhone only at first.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Right now <em>shipping v2.0 in mid August seems realistic</em> and that is what I strive to do.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Another good thing about shipping independently from the new OS version is that people that do not want to&#x000A;upgrade to iOS 7 immediately will be able to take advantage of all the features the new app brings.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>There will be time to fix bugs and maybe add one or two more features before shipping <em>v2.1, which will target iOS 7&#x000A;and leave behind support for iOS 6</em> and below. That is because the UI changes iOS 7 brings are so drastic that I&#x000A;will not be able and do not want to maintain two separate versions of the UI.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>Pricing</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>As with v1, I need to <a href="/blog/app-store-pricing">finance working on the app</a> - even more so now that I have already&#x000A;dedicated several weeks of full time work to hack on the new version.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>The <em>iPhone version will be $9.99</em> (8.99 EUR). I have not decided on a price point for the iPad version yet, but I&#x000A;think it will be a little more than that and I want to justify this by delivering a very good experience on the iPad.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Two weeks ago when I decided to ship v2.0 around mid August I cut the price of v1 in half - it is currently&#x000A;<a href="http://ioctocat.com/appstore-iphone">available on the App Store for $4.99</a>. This makes six weeks of transitioning period&#x000A;and I did this to be fair to everyone buying the app from then on. I was hoping for Apple to announce paid upgrades&#x000A;at WWDC 2013, but it seems unlikely that we will see something like that in the near future. Having paid upgrades&#x000A;would have been my favorite option, but as this will not happen I think doing it this way seems like the best option,&#x000A;because I do not think there will be an introductory price for v2.0 and I simply cannot grant existing customers a&#x000A;discount.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>The road so far and on</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I really enjoy what I am doing right now: Hacking on an app I myself need and enjoy using, contributing to open&#x000A;source <a href="https://github.com/mattt/TTTAttributedLabel/pull/243">along</a> <a href="https://github.com/RSully/RSColorPicker/pull/25">the</a>&#x000A;<a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/vlad/pull/53">way</a>, and talking to other developers that live the indy life.&#x000A;I am very grateful for the past weeks and fell in love with being able to work on what I think is best - and deciding&#x000A;what to do and deliver value whenever I open my MacBook or talk to customers.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Having said that, I hope you will enjoy v2 as much as I already did - <strong>WIN WIN</strong>.</p></div>
