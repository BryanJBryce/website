          <h1>Three Quick Wins for Responding to User Feedback</h1>
        </header>
        <div class='content'><p>Giving users an easy way to submit feedback and talk to the developer about the app should be an essential part&#x000A;of almost every app out there. I am using <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/">HockeyApp</a>&#8217;s feedback feature, which is not only&#x000A;easy to integrate, but also comes with a nice interface and makes leaving comments a seamless experience for the users.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Lately I have tried some things when responding to customer feedback and had good success with that, so I wanted to&#x000A;share my experience with you - so here are three tips for what you should try when answering your users feedback.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>Ask for a review</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>You might not want to do that in case the user is not satisfied with your app and is contacting you about problems&#x000A;she or he is experiencing. But other than that this is a very good chance to get a user to leave a review on the&#x000A;App Store: Just be kind and ask them for a short, one or two sentence long review. Oftentimes the positive feedback&#x000A;you get is ready to be recycled as an App Store review, so provide the user with a quick link to access your apps&#x000A;store page and you will increase your review count in no time.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>Point them to your mailinglist/social media outlets</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Oftentimes when people ask for a feature that is already planned or I may be working on already, I propose they&#x000A;subscribe to the mailinglist or follow the apps twitter/app.net account. This assumes that you are using these&#x000A;outlets to frequently talk about upcoming versions, stuff that is in the making or share other information that&#x000A;might be useful for your users. As taking action is just one or two clicks away this converts pretty well and&#x000A;lets your users stay in the loop.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>Use a footer/signature</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Depending on the type of feedback or request I get, I sometimes use the opportunity to point to my personal website&#x000A;or other/similar projects. The success of this is not easy to measure unless the users might let you know&#x000A;afterwards that they found the information they were looking for. Nevertheless, having a signature containing one or&#x000A;two links at the end of an email is an unobtrusive hint that might spark interest.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3>Bonus tip: Be quick</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Sometimes people are surprised to actually get an answer to their feedback (which happens more often than I expected).&#x000A;I do not only answer every request I get, but also try to do it as fast as I can. It is amazing to see how even&#x000A;disgruntled or angry users change their minds when they are taken care of as quickly as possible. A quick answer&#x000A;also sets a good ground for the other tips mentioned.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<hr />&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>All these tips take into account that the people who contact you seem to care about your app: They are loyal (and&#x000A;hopefully satisfied) users that take the time to let you know what they think and want to help you improve your&#x000A;app. I have found that those users react very positively to these pointers and some are even thankful for you letting&#x000A;them know where they can find out more or follow your app more closely - and if that is the case: Congratulations,&#x000A;you are on the right track with what you are doing.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I hope you have similar success when experimenting with these tips - let me know what you think and how your users&#x000A;react.</p></div>
